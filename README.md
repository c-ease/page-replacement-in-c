Page replacement algorithms implemented in c language: FIFO, LRU, Optimal
for reference- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/

These c programs simulates the page replacement algorithms and must be given input while keeping in mind the following format:

1. Length of refernce string must be a positive integer must be a positive integer
2. The reference string should be space-separated positive integers
3. The number of frames must be a positive integer.
